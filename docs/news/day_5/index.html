<p><strong>Controllers:</strong> Trevor Hoey (FVO), Ted Finch
(FVO) &amp; Paul Caban (INT)</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Due to ongoing works (dualling of
the A9) and safety considerations (cars stacking
back onto the A9), all vehicles should access
the area from the south through Dunkeld
(recommended route from Crieff is via Aberfeldy,
A827 to Ballinluig then south on A9 to A
signposted for Dunkeld). Traffic coming from
Perth should travel to Ballinluig and then
follow the directions above as for traffic
from Crieff. Follow A923 through Dunkeld then
follow the road north ignoring the right turn
for Blairgowrie. This is the “old” A9 and has
no road number. After approx. 5.5 km follow
signposted right turn off road onto the farm road
for Rotmell farm. Drive up the farm road - cars
and campervans will split. Pedestrians from bus
drop off will also be using the farm road. Bus
drop off is opposite road up to Rotmell Farm at
NO002468- there will be a crossing marshal.
1.4km walk uphill to the Arena sharing the vehicle
access road.</p>

Arena. Separate parking area for campervans.
