      <description>Ticks Ticks are common in the competition areas. Check carefully after each run and remove any (the recommended method is using an O’Tom Tick Twister). Lyme disease does also occur in the area; if you develop a rash at the site of a tick bite, you are advised to seek medical advice.
Tick Project: TickApp (a citizen science project run by SRUC and University of Edinburgh) will be attending (Day 1 and 3) to compare the number of ticks collected using survey transects (scientific method) with the number of ticks reported by people after orienteering in the same area.</description>
