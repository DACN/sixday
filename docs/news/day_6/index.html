<p><strong>Directions:</strong> From the North or the South take
the A9 to Ballinluig, then take the A827 towards
Aberfeldy for approx 6km. The event parking is at
the junction of the A827 and the B898.
Parking: Large flat field off the B898. Traders
and toilets will be adjacent to parking. ALL cars
to arrive by 12:00 and NO exit before 12:30.</p>

<p><strong>Arena:</strong> Access via a rough track up a steep hill,
approx 500m. Unsuitable for buggies. Toilets in
the Parking field.</p>

<p><strong>Starts:</strong> All: 2km walk on forest tracks and across
fields. Stiles over fence crossings. White/Green
start and Red/Blue/Yellow start separate, but
adjacent to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Maps:</strong> Stirling Surveys (2017) with updates by Terry O’Brien
(2019). 1:10,000 for all courses.</p>

<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> North facing hillside comprising
predominantly open, mature birch woodland and
open pasture. Some courses enter a small area
of plantation woodland. Runnability is generally
good - some areas of younger birch will slow
progress and reduce visibility. Extensive areas of
indistinct marsh mapped, however the visibility of
this on the ground and impact on running speed
will be dependent on rainfall in the run up to the
event.</p>

<p><strong>String Course:</strong> In the field just above the arena.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Information:</strong> A burn near the starts
is crossed twice by most adult courses; take
care. Four main fences in the area will have
crossing points installed, other sections will be
marked uncrossable on the map and must not be
crossed. A 2.2m high deer fence will be crossed
by all courses at a mandatory crossing point</p>

<p><strong>Elite Courses:</strong> Middle distance race: 30-
E LT. Map scale 1:10,000. Seeded start with the
highest ranked competitor from the previous 5
days starting last.</p>

<p><strong>Junior courses:</strong> The area has few paths and
tracks and as a result the TD1 and TD2 courses
will, for a large part of the courses, follow fences
and walls rather than paths and tracks. For all
TD1-3 courses the underfoot conditions may be
relatively slow going in places with wet feet a
high probability. There will be one short section
of taped route on TD1 and TD2 courses.</p>
