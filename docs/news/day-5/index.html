    <p>#Day 5 (World Ranking Event)
#Friday 2nd August
#Craig a Barns
&gt;##<strong>Special Information:</strong><br />
&gt;##In the competition area, there has been an occurrence of <em>Pythopthera Ramorum</em>, a deadly tree pathogen causing major problems in parts of Scotland. Recent felling has occurred – <strong>DO NOT</strong> enter felled areas marked as Out-of-Bounds by purple overprint.</p>

<p><strong>Organising Clubs:</strong> TAY, INVOC, ELO</p>

<p><strong>Organisers:</strong> Fiona Downie &amp; Jane Anderson (TAY)</p>

<p><strong>Planners:</strong> Dave Summers &amp; Kevin Holliday (INVOC)</p>

<p><strong>Controllers:</strong> Trevor Hoey (FVO), Ted Finch (FVO) &amp; Paul Caban (INT)</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Due to ongoing works (dualling of the A9) and safety considerations (cars stacking back onto the A9), <strong>all vehicles should access the area from the south through Dunkeld</strong> (recommended route from Crieff is via Aberfeldy, A827 to Ballinluig then south on A9 to A923 signposted for Dunkeld).</p>

<p>Traffic coming from Perth should travel to Ballinluig and then follow the directions above as for traffic from Crieff. Follow A923 through Dunkeld then follow the road north ignoring the right turn for Blairgowrie. This is the “old” A9 and has no road number. After approx. 5.5 km follow signposted right turn off road onto the farm road for Rotmell farm. Drive up the farm road - cars and campervans will split.</p>

<p>Pedestrians from bus drop off will also be using the farm road. Bus drop off is opposite road up to Rotmell Farm at NO002468- there will be a crossing marshal. 1.4km walk uphill to the Arena sharing the vehicle access road.</p>

<p><strong>Parking:</strong> Flattish parking fields adjacent to Arena. Separate parking area for campervans. <strong>NO exit before 12:30.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Arena:</strong> Sloping field across from parking fields. Take care crossing track. Downhill run in.</p>

</blockquote>
