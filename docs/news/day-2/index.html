<blockquote>
<p>#Starts:<br />
##All: leave southwest corner of Arena. Cross the busy A84 at the manned crossing point. A 0.4 km walk beside A84 using a narrow pavement - take great care (young juniors should be supervised along this section) then an uphill track for 1.2km. Toilets and clothing dump at this point.<br />
