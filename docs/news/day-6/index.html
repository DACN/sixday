    <h1></h1>
    <p>#Day 6 (UKOL)
#Saturday 3rd August
#Grandtully
<strong>Organising Clubs:</strong> GRAMP, KFO, RR</p>

<p><strong>Organisers:</strong> Sam Gomersall &amp; Lesley Gomersall (GRAMP)</p>

<p><strong>Planners:</strong> Pete Lawrence &amp; Zoe Griffin (GRAMP)</p>

<p><strong>Controllers:</strong> Andy Oliver (MAROC) &amp; Simon Gardner (CLYDE)</p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong> From the North or the South take the A9 to Ballinluig, then take the A827 towards Aberfeldy for approx 6km. The event parking is at the junction of the A827 and the B898.</p>

<p><strong>Parking:</strong> Large flat field off the B898. Traders and toilets will be adjacent to parking. <strong>ALL cars to arrive by 12:00 and NO exit before 12:30.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Arena:</strong> Access via a rough track up a steep hill, approx 500m. Unsuitable for buggies. <strong>Toilets in the Parking field.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>##<strong>Starts:</strong><br />
##All: 2km walk on forest tracks and across fields. Stiles over fence crossings. White/Green start and Red/Blue/Yellow start separate, but adjacent to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Maps:</strong> SS (2017) with updates by Terry O’Brien (2019). 1:10,000 for all courses.</p>

<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> North facing hillside comprising predominantly open, mature birch woodland and open pasture. Some courses enter a small area of plantation woodland. Runnability is generally good - some areas of younger birch will slow progress and reduce visibility. Extensive areas of indistinct marsh mapped, however the visibility of this on the ground and impact on running speed will be dependent on rainfall in the run up to the event.</p>

<p><strong>String Course:</strong> In the field just above the arena.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Information:</strong> A burn near the starts is crossed twice by most adult courses; take care. Four main fences in the area will have crossing points installed, other sections will be marked uncrossable on the map and must not be crossed. A 2.2m high deer fence will be crossed by all courses at a mandatory crossing point.</p>

<p><strong>Elite Courses:</strong> Middle distance race: 30-35 ELT. Map scale 1:10,000. Seeded start with the highest ranked competitor from the previous 5 days starting last.</p>

<p><strong>Junior courses:</strong> The area has few paths and tracks and as a result the TD1 and TD2 courses will, for a large part of the courses, follow fences and walls rather than paths and tracks. For all TD1-3 courses the underfoot conditions may be relatively slow going in places with wet feet a high probability. There will be one short section of taped route on TD1 and TD2 courses.</p>
