#### Ticks

Ticks are common in the competition
areas. Check carefully after each run and
remove any (the recommended method
is using an Oâ€™Tom Tick Twister). Lyme
disease does also occur in the area; if you
develop a rash at the site of a tick bite, you
are advised to seek medical advice.

##### Tick Project: 

TickApp (a citizen science
project run by SRUC and University of
Edinburgh) will be attending (Day 1 and 3)
to compare the number of ticks collected
using survey transects (scientific method)
with the number of ticks reported by people
after orienteering in the same area. These
data will be used to get better measures
of how often people encounter ticks whilst
doing outdoor activities, and help map tick
distribution in Scotland. If you are aged
18 and over, or if you are a parent of a
junior aged < 18yrs, we would be grateful
if you would come to our tick tent after
your course and report whether you found
any ticks or not. Your participation is
needed! Please consider contributing
to this important study.

##### E-Coli 0157
E-Coli 0157 may be found where farm
animals have been grazing the fields used
for Parking and Arenas as well as the
competition area. It is recommended that
you wash your hands thoroughly before
eating.



##### Dehydration
Dehydration. If the weather is hot, make
sure that you drink plenty of fluids.
