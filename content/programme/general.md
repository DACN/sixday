Competitor’s overall score will be the sum of their best 4 scores of the week. In the event of a tie between 2 or more competitors, the competitor with the lowest individual day score will win. Competitors who fail to finish, do not start or are disqualified will be awarded a points score which is higher than the total number of active competitors.

##### Prizes: 
Prize giving will take place at 15:00 on the last day (including Trail ‘O’). There will be awards for the top 3 overall in each class with additional mementos for places 4-6 in 16 classes. Spot prizes shall be distributed throughout the week.
